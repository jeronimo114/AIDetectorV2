PDFs are great for sharing documents, but they are frustrating to edit. Markdown is lightweight, portable, and easy to publish. A PDF to Markdown converter bridges that gap by extracting the text and formatting it as Markdown you can clean up quickly.

## Quick answer

- Convert a PDF into Markdown you can edit in seconds.
- Best for text based PDFs such as reports, essays, and notes.
- Scanned PDFs need OCR before conversion.

## What the converter does

Our PDF to Markdown tool extracts text from each page and rebuilds it into a readable Markdown structure. It keeps paragraphs, headings, and lists where possible so you spend less time reformatting.

Try it here: [PDF to Markdown Converter](/tools/pdf-to-md).

## When to use PDF to Markdown

Use a converter when you need to:

- Edit a PDF report in a Markdown editor
- Move content into a CMS or documentation site
- Create a clean draft for rewriting or summarizing
- Archive documents in a version control friendly format

## What to expect from the output

PDFs do not store structure the same way Markdown does, so conversion is a best effort process. Most text based PDFs convert well, but complex layouts may need some cleanup. Headings and lists are detected when possible, and the output is easy to adjust.

## Tips for cleaner Markdown

- If your PDF is a scan, run OCR first.
- Remove page headers and footers after conversion.
- Check lists and headings for consistency.
- Reflow paragraphs if the PDF uses narrow columns.

## FAQ

**Does it upload my file?**

No. The conversion runs locally in your browser.

**Will it keep images and tables?**

Text is converted first. You may need to re add images or tables manually.

**Why does a scanned PDF return little text?**

Scans are images, not selectable text. Use OCR before converting.

**How big of a PDF can I convert?**

Smaller files convert faster. Very large files may take longer depending on your device.

**Where should I edit the Markdown?**

Any editor works. Many people use VS Code, Obsidian, or a Markdown enabled CMS.
