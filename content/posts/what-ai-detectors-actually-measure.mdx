AI detectors do not detect intent or authorship. They measure patterns in language that are statistically associated with AI generated text. That means a detector score is a probability, not proof. Understanding what is measured can help students interpret results and revise calmly.

## Quick answer

- Detectors measure statistical patterns, not who wrote the text.
- Signals include predictability, sentence consistency, and repetition.
- Human writing can trigger the same signals, especially in academic style.

## The core signals detectors look for

Most detectors analyze a mix of signals. The exact weighting differs by tool, but the common patterns include:

### Predictability

AI generated text often chooses the most likely next word. Detectors measure how predictable word choices are compared to typical human writing.

### Sentence variation

Human writing usually varies in sentence length and complexity. Low variation can look machine like, even when written by a human.

### Burstiness

Burstiness refers to shifts in complexity. Human writing often moves between simple and complex phrasing. Consistent complexity can look artificial.

### Repetition and templated phrasing

Repeated transitions or generic phrasing can raise risk scores. This happens in academic writing when students follow standard templates.

## Why these signals are imperfect

These signals are statistical, not definitive. They do not capture the full context of writing. A well edited human essay can appear uniform, while an AI generated text can be modified to appear more human.

Because of this, detectors can produce false positives and false negatives.

## Why academic writing triggers detectors

Academic essays often use consistent structure, formal tone, and common phrases. These are exactly the traits detectors associate with AI patterns. That is why students are more likely to see higher risk scores, even when they wrote the work themselves.

## How to interpret a detector score

A score should be treated as a signal. The most responsible approach is to:

- Look for tools that show confidence ranges
- Review the specific sections that appear uniform
- Revise for clarity and specificity

Tools that provide explanations are more useful for students than tools that provide a single score.

## What a good self check should provide

A student focused tool should:

- Explain which signals are driving a result
- Offer confidence ranges that reflect uncertainty
- Provide guidance for revision

Veridict is designed with these principles so students can self check without fear.

## FAQ

**Do detectors look for plagiarism?**

AI detection is different from plagiarism detection. It focuses on language patterns rather than text similarity.

**Can I lower my score by changing a few words?**

Small changes can shift scores, but the safest approach is to revise for clarity and specificity rather than random edits.

**Why do detectors disagree about the same essay?**

They use different models and thresholds, so disagreement is normal.

**Should I avoid formal academic writing?**

No. You can write formally while still adding your own voice and specific details.

**What is the best way to protect myself?**

Keep drafts and notes, and use a self check tool to review signals before you submit.
